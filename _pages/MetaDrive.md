## MetaDrive Simulator

To facilitate the research of generalizable reinforcement learning, we develop an open-source, highly efficient and flexible driving simulator MetaDrive, which holds the following key features:

* Modular
* Lightweight
* Customizable
* Realistic

We construct a variety of RL tasks and baselines in both single-agent and multi-agent settings, including benchmarking
generalizability across unseen scenes, safe exploration, and modeling multi-agent behaviors.

Empowered by ***[ScenarioNet](../scenarionet)***, all features of MetaDrive can be applied to 
the virtual environments reconstructed from the open-source dataset, such as Waymo Open Dataset, nuPlan, and L5.
