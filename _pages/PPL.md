## Summary

We develop a novel **Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL)** method. 

* PPL predicts future failures with a lightweight trajectory predictor (runs at >1,000 fps on CPU) and helps human experts intervene promptly. 
* PPL converts expert takeovers into contrastive preference labels applied over predicted future states.

In experiments on driving (MetaDrive) and manipulation (RoboSuite), under both  real human participants and neural experts, PPL:

* Achieves 2x improvement in sample efficiency and reduces expert takeover cost compared to interactive imitation learning (IIL) baselines.
* Robust to trajectory-prediction noise and to imperfect experts, and consistently outperforms baselines under these realistic perturbations.

We also provide a theoretical analysis that:

* Upper bounds on the performance gap by the preference-dataset error, state-distribution shift, and training loss.
* Explains how to select the preference horizon $$L$$ to balance these trade-offs.

## Motivation

Existing IIL methods impose **high cognitive burdens** on humans as they require humans to constantly monitor the agent, anticipate future failures, and intervene in real time. Moreover, they do not fully utilize the agent's **predicted future behaviors**, resulting in repeated human corrections and poor sample efficiency.

We propose Predictive Preference Learning (PPL) to reduce human workload and improve training efficiency. PPL combines a **lightweight trajectory predictor** and **preference learning**: the former helps humans proactively decide when to intervene, and the latter trains the agent to avoid future unsafe behaviors.

## Predictive Preference Learning

As illustrated in the figure below, our method PPL operates through human-agent interaction and preference propagation over predicted trajectories.

**Agentâ€™s exploratory trajectories**: At each decision step, the agent proposes an action 
$$ a_n $$ 
from its novice policy 
$$ \pi_n $$,
and a future rollout is predicted using a trajectory model 
$$ f(s, a_n, H) $$. 
This rollout 
$$ \tau = (s, \tilde{s}_1, \dots, \tilde{s}_H) $$
is visualized, and the agent proceeds autonomously unless the human anticipates failure.

**Human Demonstrations**: If the expert foresees risk (e.g., collisions), they intervene by suggesting corrective actions 
$$ a_h \sim \pi_h(s) $$,
and we record 
$$ (s, a_h) $$ 
into a human buffer 
$$ \mathcal{D}_h $$
for behavioral cloning. Importantly, we also treat this intervention as an implicit preference: the human prefers 
$$ a_h $$ 
over 
$$ a_n $$
not just at 
$$ s $$,
but also at multiple predicted future states 
$$ \tilde{s}_1, \dots, \tilde{s}_L $$,
forming tuples 
$$ (\tilde{s}_i, a^+ = a_h, a^- = a_n) $$
stored in a preference buffer 
$$ \mathcal{D}_\text{pref} $$.


**Learning with two complementary losses**: We train the policy $$\pi_\theta$$ with:

1) A behavioral cloning loss on expert demonstrations:

 $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{BC}}(\pi_\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_{(s, a_h) \sim \mathcal{D}_h} \left[ \log \pi_\theta(a_h \mid s) \right]$$.  

2) A contrastive preference loss over predicted states:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{pref}}(\pi_\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_{(\tilde{s}, a^+, a^-) \sim \mathcal{D}_\text{pref}} \left[ \log \sigma \left( \beta \log \pi_\theta(a^+ \mid \tilde{s}) - \beta \log \pi_\theta(a^- \mid \tilde{s}) \right) \right]$$.

This design allows the agent to propagate expert intent into imagined states before entering risky regions, enabling safer and more efficient policy learning with fewer interventions.

## Experiment

Compared to the IIL baselines, our method PPL achieves superior learning efficiency in the following tasks:

Our method PPL saves 40% human demonstrations but achieves better evaluation performance in the MetaDrive environment.

We also verify that PPL is robust to noises in the trajectory prediction model. Choosing an approximate preference horizon is essential for PPL.
